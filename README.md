# Obstacle Avoiding Robocar
This is a repository for an obstacle avoiding robocar that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and change direction accordingly.

## Components
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
3. L298N Motor Driver
4. 4 DC Motors
5. Servo Motor
6. Jumper Wires
## Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
```https://github.com/ZigbeeFETSC/Obstacle-Avoiding-RoboCar.git```

2. Connect the ultrasonic sensor and L298N motor driver to the Arduino Uno board as per the wiring diagram provided in the repository.
3. Connect the 4 DC motors to the L298N motor driver.
4. Upload the obstacle_avoiding_robocar.ino sketch to the Arduino Uno board using the Arduino IDE.
5. Power up the robocar and place it on a flat surface.
6. Observe how the robocar moves and avoids obstacles as detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
